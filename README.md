# Python_Hangman

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to figure out a hidden word by suggesting letters.

At the start, the player sees the word with all its letters replaced by underscores (_), so they only know how many letters are in the word.

In each round, the player guesses a letter. If the guessed letter is in the word, its position (or positions, if the letter is in multiple parts of the word) is revealed. The player wins when they correctly guess all the letters of the word.

However, if the guessed letter is not in the word, the player gets a mistake. If the player makes six mistakes without guessing the word, they lose.
